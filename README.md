# Loulou Clicker 


This is a ["Cookie Clicker"](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) type game. The theme was Loulou from Disney. The concept was to click the cookie (i.e. loulou head) and gain as many points as possible. You would receive rewards, become more efficient and build an Empire of cookies (i.e. points)!

This was a group project built by a team of 5 developers. The objective was to create a responsive web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
We used the Agile Methodology to complete the task efficiently and on time.
